This project aims at providing tabletop RPG masters with :

  * An indexing system aimed at their ressources (e-books, web ressources, images, maps, soundtrack and effects, etc.)

  * An abstract campaign manager to organise ideas and ressources into game elements (campaigns, scenarios, actors, locations, timelines, etc.)

  * Game-system specific plugins to manage system related tools and structured data (dice bags, stat blocks, game specific tools, etc.)

This project is based upon the eclipse RCP framework and integrates several other EPL and GPL components, as well as homebrew extensions for the aforementioned.
