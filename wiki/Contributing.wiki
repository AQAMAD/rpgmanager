#summary How to help in RPGM development.

= Help Wanted =

Hi all, and thanks for looking up this page, it means you're willing to help.

= How to apply =

To apply to become a member of the RPGM team, please post an issue in the bug tracking system explaining what you feel like doing. We will add you to the project members and you will get niceties like "preview" versions (nightly builds) and your name mentioned in the "about" dialog box (great huh ?).

Three tasks are currently lacking contributors to help improve on what RPGM already is.

== Practical help ==

If you feel like you can contribute any of the following, please apply

  * Testing (windows, linux and mac users)
  * Documenting (to improve this wiki and the help system)
  * Suggestions for new features or feature improvements
  
== Technical help ==

We are in need of technicians, mostly developpers. If you have any experience or are willing to learn any of the following, please apply. 

  * Any Java developer (we are amateurs, so professionals are most welcome)
  * Knowledge of Eclipse RCP framework, PDE, SWT, JFace is a plus
  * Ant, or even better Tycho (this would be so great)

== Content help ==

RPGM will be a great system if, and only if, we manage to get it "sexy" and "useful", so feel free to apply if you can provide

  * Design and illustrations (icons, splash screens, art of any kind)
  * Content (campaigns, scenarios, actors, more on that later)
