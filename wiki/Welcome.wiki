= Introduction =

Welcome to RPGM !

This project is currently under development and will need extensive documentation, though at the time I am working on getting up to date with the old website.

Note that as of October 13th 2010 RPGM is now officially open-source and welcomes contributors of all kind.

Things to do before anouncing version 1.0
  * Finish *WIKI* documentation and screenshots _and_ videos
  * Wrap up technical details needed to simplify the current API
  * Finish the new features before release (persistance layer, workspace management)
  * Work on game specific plugins
