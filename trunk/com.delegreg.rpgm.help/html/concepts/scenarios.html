<h1>Scenarios</h1>
<P>Now, you know what a campaign is all about, let's talk scenarios.</P>
<P>Your PCs have a goal, they need to reach it (or not, though it's rather anticlimatic).</P>
<P>We talked about the step-by-step way to do so, let's talk about the steps.</P>
<P>These steps (or Scenarios) are the books in a saga, the film in a trilogy (or quadrilogy, or sextology..).</P>
<P>Think of your scenarios as the "rather big" accomplishment.</P>
<P>The key to a good scenario is having a good starting point and a good end point.</P>
<P>Too long a scenario ? The players get bored.</P>
<P>Too short a scenario ? The players get bored too.</P>
<P>Your Scenarios should take the players after a "pause" in the storytelling.</P>
<P>Days, Weeks, Months have gone by and the adventurers (or investigators, or whatever) are needed again.</P>
<P>They will again face challenges, battle evil minions (or their commanders as they progress) and save the day.</P>
<P>Make it so they feel their victory (or loss) before your close the scenario, and they'll be hungry for the next one.</P>
