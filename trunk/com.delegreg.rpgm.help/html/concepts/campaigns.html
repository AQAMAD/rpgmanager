<h1>Campaigns</h1>
<P>A campaign represents all the events to unfold between the time you gather the player group and the time they have achieved a major goal.</P>
<P>You, as a GM, need to define this significant goal, and give the means to your PCs to achieve it.</P>
<P>To do so, the players will need to progress step-by-step towards this goal.</P>
<P>Each step on this way is represented by a Scenario (we will get there soon).</P>
<P>Think of your campaign as the "once-in-a-lifetime" accomplishment.</P>
<P>If you were designing the "Lord of the Rings" Campaign, this goal would be "destroy the One ring".</P>
<P>If you were designing the "Star Wars" Campaign, this goal would be "free the Galaxy".</P>
<P>Now do you see were this is headed ?</P>
