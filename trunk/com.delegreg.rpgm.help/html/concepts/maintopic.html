<h1>RPGM Concepts</h1>
<P>As a GM, your experience with RPGM revolves around building Campaigns and using Ressources.</P>
<P>These concepts will be detailed to allow you to better organize your sessions and make full use of your creativity
to build exciting adventures.</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Campaigns are the major focus, they are the epic quests that you play for years.</LI>
	<LI>Scenarios are their building blocks, the sequence campaigns and are the steps to victory, a game session is rarely enough to play out a scenario.</LI>
	<LI>Sequences are scenarios's building blocks, they are the chapters in the book, individual events that your play, a typical game session takes your players through a few sequences.</LI>
	<LI>Locations are important factors, they represent the places your player visit, or will visit throughout the campaign.</LI>
	<LI>Actors are the major focus of interaction. Recurring villains, tribes of minions, sympathic NPCs and your player characters are all actors in your campaign.</LI>
	<LI>Document Ressources are there to help you find your way through the huge reference of game books/texts you need, they help you get quickly to that nifty spell or the description of the 3rd level of the shinra complex.</LI>
	<LI>Audio Ressources help you build that mood that you cherish so much.</LI>
