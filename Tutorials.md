# Introduction #

Welcome to the RPGM tutorials page. We hope these instructions will help you understand and take full control of the RPGM system.

These tutorials take these assertions for granted :

  * You know what a tabletop (pen and paper) RPG is
  * You are a player or game master
  * You have faced the thousands of ressources available on the web
  * You regularly use a computer for preparing your game sessions
  * You sometimes use a computer during your game sessions

We, at the RPGM crew, do not believe in formal documentation, so all the help and guidance you need will be found in these pages. Think of them as the "RPGM user's guide" if you will.

# Library tutorials #

RPGM is first and foremost a ressources indexing system. What this means is that RPGM was built to help you manage the following ressources :

  * [Web](Webdocs.md) documents
  * [PDF](Pdfdocs.md) documents
  * [Image](Imgdocs.md) documents
  * [Audio](Audiodocs.md) documents

... using these tools :

  * [Libraries](LibraryMainView.md) in the main view
  * [Web](Webbrowser.md) browser view
  * [PDF](Pdfbrowser.md) view
  * [Image](Imagebrowser.md) view
  * [Audio](Audioplayer.md) player view

# Game content tutorials #

RPGM was made to help game masters build and run scenarios and campaigns (or adventure paths if you know what i mean).

## Game system agnostic tutorials ##

RPGM is "game system agnostic" in that it does not strongly adhere to one single game sytem and is able to run any campaign you may think of

RPGM is able to manage the following game notions :

  * [Campaigns](CampainsMainView.md) in the main view
  * [Campaign](Campaign.md)
  * [Scenario](Scenario.md) (and Sidequest)
  * [Locations](Locations.md)
  * [Actors](Actors.md)
  * [Statblocks](Statblocks.md)

## Game system specific tutorials ##

RPGM is "extensible" in that it allows for some game-system specific content. These are managed using "extensions" (also known as "plugins").

Extensions add features to RPGM in two different ways :

  * You get game specific Statblocks
  * You get game specific Tools

Two plugins will be developped by the main RPGM crew, other plugins may appear depending on contributors

  * The D20 (3.5, pathfinder) plugin
  * The Basic (Runequest, Call of Cthulhu) plugin

# Remaining tutorials #

RPGM is a program, and as such it has features that dont fall in the aforementioned categories. These are mainly the system features :

  * Workspace management
  * Saving, loading files
  * Exporting, Importing files
  * Managing preferences
  * Managing extensions
  * The help system
